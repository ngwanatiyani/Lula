# Lula

**Lula** is a web-based application designed to provide a streamlined and user-friendly experience. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project focuses on simplicity and performance.

> **Note:** "Lula" implies "easy" or "simple" in several South African languages, reflecting the core philosophy of this application.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design:** A clean interface that works across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI:** Dynamic user interactions powered by `app.js`.
- **Lightweight:** No heavy framework dependencies; just pure, efficient code.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the application structure.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout (`main.css`).
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For application logic and interactivity (`app.js`).
